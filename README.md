## Bloomberg School of Public Health Health Communication 
Survey for the sleep hygiene group

- Overall stats can be found [here](https://tivanics.github.io/BloombergSPH_survey/Sleephygienestats.html)

### Composite outcome defined according to sleep duration (good 7-9 hours), quality, and consistency in wakeup.
- Stratified data with equal weighting between variables (i.e. max 1 point for 7-9 hrs, max 1 point for quality, max 1 point for consistency) [here](https://tivanics.github.io/BloombergSPH_survey/Sleephygieneanalysis_scoremax3.html)

- Stratified data with 7-9 hours of sleep more heavily weighted (i.e. 2 points for 7-9 hrs, max 1 point for quality, max 1 point for consistency) [here](https://tivanics.github.io/BloombergSPH_survey/Sleephygieneanalysis_scoremax4.html)

- Stratified data with equal weighting between variables, if the total score is 2 or more you get a 1 (binary) (good sleep) otherwise 0 (bad sleep) [here](https://tivanics.github.io/BloombergSPH_survey/Sleephygieneanalysis_scorelessthan2badscoregreaterorequalto2good.html)

### Composite outcome defined according to sleep duration (good 7-9 hours), quality, and consistency in wakeup. Logistic regression (primarily univariable) (dependent variable is good sleep [â‰¥2 points])
- Logistic regression Mar 23 2021 [here](https://tivanics.github.io/BloombergSPH_survey/Logisticregressionmarch23.html)

### Composite outcome defined according to sleep duration (good 7-9 hours), quality, and consistency in wakeup. Multivariable Logistic regression (dependent variable is bad sleep [<2 points])
- Multivariable Logistic regression Mar 24 2021 [here](https://tivanics.github.io/BloombergSPH_survey/Multivariablemodel.html)
